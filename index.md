# SONG: Self-Organizing Nebulous Growths for Incremental Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction

This repository contains the python implementation of the Self-Organizing Nebulous Growths (SONG) algorithm. SONG is based on the principles of Vector Quantization, Self Organization and the Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction of input data through graph embedding. 



## Installation

SONG is currently available through GitHub and you can easily install the library using the following command. 

```
   $ cd <clone_path> 
   $ python3 setup.py install
   ```
